This method wasn't made by me, but it hasn't been popularised, so I thought I should mention it as many people want to reset Atlas to default.

Atlas as you may know doesn't come with a function to reset back to default Windows like normal Windows does, so I will tell you how to do this

First you will need a Windows 10 ISO file, if you don't know how to get one Atlas actually tells you on the docs [here](https://docs.atlasos.net/getting-started/installation/#download-an-iso)

From here, right-click the file and `Mount`, or if 7-Zip takes over, extract the ISO into a suitable place. Do not use the GUI because we don't want anything to not work

From here, run `setup.exe` and follow through the options. Hopefully Windows 10 should be installed safely and not Atlas!
