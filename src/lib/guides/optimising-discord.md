These methods I am going to mention can be against Discord's ToS but the likeliness of you getting banned is minimal, I'll mention what to avoid though for obvious reasons

Discord by itself is not very efficent on your systems resources, but for some reason [Discord Canary](https://canary.discord.com/) gives you better system usage overall, it is totally ok to use this as an alternative as this application is made by Discord

As an alternative you can try [OpenAsar](https://openasar.dev/). It is a Discord optimiser which can fix any issue, it works with Canary too. It is against ToS though!
